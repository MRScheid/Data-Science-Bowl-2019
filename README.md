# Data-Science-Bowl-2019
'Data Science Bowl 2019 Project.ipynb'- Code for cleaning, munging, EDA, model building and evaluation for the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2019.  

Using gameplay data from a children’s educational app, the goal of the competition was to use the gameplay data to predict child's performance on assessments within the app.  Using factors of gameplay that I found influenced assessment performance, I built a kNN model that had 80% accuracy in predicting the child’s performance on assessments.
